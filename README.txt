Ciao!
This is my first mod, so sorry if there are any errors or english typos.

This mod adds to your minetest game various type of sandwiches,
including vegetarian, nutella and many more.
There are also some other related food like jam and a sweet 
bread pudding, made from sandwiches crumbs.
You can now have PB&J sandwich!
