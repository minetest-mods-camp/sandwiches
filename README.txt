Ciao!
This is my first mod, so sorry if there are any errors or english typos.

This mod adds to your minetest game various type of sandwiches,
including vegetarian, nutella and many more.
There are also some other related food like jam and a sweet 
bread pudding, made from sandwiches crumbs.

Developed and tested on Minetest 0.4.16

Current version: v 1.3 made moretrees optional
v 1.2 - replaced meat with craftable ham
v 1.1 - fixed some on_use values
v 1.0 - the very first release;

This mod has some dependencies, so be careful with the installation.
